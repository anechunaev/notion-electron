title: Notion Electron
summary: Unoffical Notion client

description: |
  Unofficial desktop application for Notion, built as an Electron wrapper with additional features. Fully functional clients for Notion Calendar and Notion Mail included as dedicated tabs.

  Some of notable features include:
  * **Integrated Notion Tools** — Fully functional dedicated tabs for Notion Calendar and Notion Mail within the same application. This approach saves system memory by reusing a single Electron process compared to running separate clients.
  * **Theme Support** — Switch effortlessly between light and dark UI themes.
  * **Tray Icon** — Minimize the application to the system tray for quick access. For environments without the tray like Gnome, there are actions available to access app options and updates.
  * **Performance Tweaks** — Optimized to reduce startup time for faster access.
  * **Browser-Like Tabs** — Tabs behave just like in a web browser: each has its own history, can be reordered, pinned, or even dragged from Notion Electron to your browser.
